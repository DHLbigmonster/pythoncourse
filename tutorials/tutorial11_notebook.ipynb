    "2. Write a test suite (3-4 functions) covering the following scenarios:\n",
    "   * **Buying Stock:** Verify that buying a stock reduces cash and adds the ticker/quantity to the portfolio.\n",
    "   * **Insufficient Funds:** Verify that trying to buy more stock than you can afford raises a `ValueError` (use `pytest.raises`).\n",
    "   * **Selling Stock:** Verify that selling stock increases cash and decreases the portfolio quantity.\n",
    "   * **Portfolio Value:** Verify the `total_value(current_prices)` method calculates the correct sum of cash + current market value of holdings."

    "### Exercise 5 (Complex Parametrization & Financial Logic)\n",
    "\n",
    "Financial formulas often behave differently depending on the input parameters (e.g., a bond trades at par, premium, or discount depending on the coupon vs. yield). Testing these relationships via parametrization ensures your logic holds up across the entire curve.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have a function `bond_price` that calculates the present value of a bond using the formula:\n",
    "$$P = \\sum_{t=1}^{T} \\frac{C}{(1+r)^t} + \\frac{F}{(1+r)^T}$$\n",
    "Where $C$ is the coupon payment ($C=F*c$, with $c$ being the coupon rate), $F$ is face value, $r$ is the yield to maturity (YTM), and $T$ is maturity in years.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Task:**\n",
    "1. Write a test function `test_bond_pricing_scenarios` decorated with `@pytest.mark.parametrize`.\n",
    "2. You must test at least **three distinct economic scenarios** (pass these as tuples in the parametrization):\n",
    "   * **Par Bond:** If `coupon_rate` == `ytm`, Price should equal Face Value (1000).\n",
    "   * **Discount Bond:** If `ytm` > `coupon_rate` (e.g., 5% vs 3%), Price should be **<** Face Value.\n",
    "   * **Zero Coupon Bond:** If `coupon_rate` is 0, Price should be exactly $\\frac{F}{(1+r)^T}$.\n",
    "3. Within the test function, use `pytest.approx` for the price assertions to handle floating-point math."
