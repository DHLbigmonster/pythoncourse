    "| **(b)** | ✅ **YES** | If the CSV file contains only headers and no data rows, the list `incomes` will be empty. Then `sum(incomes) / len(incomes)` becomes `0 / 0`, raising **ZeroDivisionError**. |\n",
    "| **(c)** | ❌ **NO** | Once a file is opened with `with open()` and iterated over (as `csv.DictReader` does internally), the iterator is exhausted. You cannot iterate again without reopening the file. The `with` block also closes the file automatically. |\n",

    "| **(c)** | ✅ **YES** | The corrected code properly iterates `for date, daily_total in sales_per_day.items()` and compares accumulated daily totals. This correctly solves the problem. |\n",
    "| **(d)** | ✅ **YES** | Using `max(sales_per_day.items(), key=lambda item: item[1])` returns a tuple `(date, daily_total)` where `daily_total` is maximum.

    "| **Date Arithmetic** | Assuming date subtraction returns an integer | Date subtraction returns `timedelta`; use `.days` for integer days |\n",

    "| **CSV Iterator** | Attempting to iterate a `DictReader` multiple times | Must reopen file or create a new reader; iterators are consumed |\n",
    "| **Path Handling** | Using hardcoded `/` or `\\` in paths | Use `os.path.join()` for cross-platform compatibility |\n",
    "| **Directory Deletion** | Using `os.rmdir()` on non-empty directories | Use `shutil.rmtree()` or delete files first |\n",
    "| **Debugging Logic** | Confusing individual values with aggregated values | Use breakpoints to inspect intermediate values during iteration |\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Part A Questions:**\n",
    "   - Pay close attention to **return types** (e.g., `datetime` vs `timedelta` vs `int`)\n",
    "   - Know **module function names** (`csv.DictReader`, `os.path.exists`, etc.)\n",
    "   - Understand **edge cases** (empty files, directory existence, negative dates)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Part B Questions:**\n",
    "   - **Read carefully**: \"which are correct\" means potentially multiple answers\n",
    "   - **Test edge cases**: empty data, boundary conditions, type mismatches\n",
    "   - **Know module limitations**: `os.rmdir()` only works on empty directories, `csv.DictReader` returns strings, etc.\n",
    "   - **Recognize Pythonic alternatives**: `max()` with `key` parameter, list comprehensions, etc."

    "| **(a)** | ❌ **NO** | `csv.DictReader` reads all values as **strings** by default. Type conversion (like `int(row[\"Income\"])`) must be done manually, as shown in the code with `int(row[\"Income\"])`. |\n",
    "| **(b)** | ✅ **YES** | If the CSV file contains only headers and no data rows, the list `incomes` will be empty. Then `sum(incomes) / len(incomes)` becomes `0 / 0`, raising **ZeroDivisionError**. |\n",
    "| **(c)** | ❌ **NO** | Once a file is opened with `with open()` and iterated over (as `csv.DictReader` does internally), the iterator is exhausted. You cannot iterate again without reopening the file. The `with` block also closes the file automatically. |\n",

    "| **(b)** | ✅ **YES** | Because the buggy code compared `sales` (single transaction) instead of `daily_total`, it identified the **date of the highest single transaction**, not the **day with the highest accumulated sales**. Exercise 4 specifically identifies this as Bug 2. |\n",
    "| **(c)** | ✅ **YES** | The corrected code properly iterates `for date, daily_total in sales_per_day.items()` and compares accumulated daily totals. This correctly solves the problem. |\n",
    "| **(d)** | ✅ **YES** | Using `max(sales_per_day.items(), key=lambda item: item[1])` returns a tuple `(date, daily_total)` where `daily_total` is maximum. This is functionally equivalent to the loop and is more Pythonic. Example: `highest_day, highest_sales = max(sales_per_day.items(), key=lambda item: item[1])`. |\n",

    "\n",
    "| Topic | Common Mistake | Correct Approach |\n",
    "|-------|----------------|------------------|\n",
    "| **Date Arithmetic** | Assuming `(date1 - date2)` returns an integer | Date subtraction returns `timedelta`; use `.days` for integer days |\n",
    "| **CSV Type Conversion** | Expecting automatic type conversion from CSV | All CSV values are strings; convert manually with `int()`, `float()`, etc. |\n",
    "| **CSV Iterator** | Attempting to iterate a `DictReader` multiple times | Must reopen file or create new reader; iterators are consumed after first iteration |\n",
    "| **Empty CSV Files** | Not handling division by zero with empty data | Check `len(incomes) > 0` before division or handle `ZeroDivisionError` |\n",
    "| **Path Handling** | Using hardcoded `/` or `\\` in file paths | Use `os.path.join()` for automatic cross-platform path separators |\n",
    "| **Directory Operations** | Using `os.rmdir()` on directories with files | Only works on empty directories; use `shutil.rmtree()` for non-empty dirs |\n",
    "| **File Closure** | Forgetting to close files after reading | Always use `with` context manager for automatic file closure |\n",
    "| **Debugging Logic Errors** | Comparing single values instead of aggregates | Debug by inspecting intermediate values; watch for off-by-one or aggregation errors |\n",
    "| **Date Parsing** | Not handling timezone-naive datetime objects | `datetime.today()` returns naive datetime (no timezone); use `datetime.now()` for UTC-aware |\n",
    "| **Datetime Formatting** | Mixing up `strptime()` (parse) vs `strftime()` (format) | `strptime()` creates datetime from string; `strftime()` converts datetime to string |\n",

    "### Exam Strategy Tips\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Part A Questions:**\n",
    "   - Pay close attention to **return types**: `datetime` vs `timedelta` vs `int`\n",
    "   - Know **module function names** exactly: `csv.DictReader`, `os.path.exists()`, `os.path.join()`\n",
    "   - Understand **edge cases**: empty files, directory existence, negative dates, type conversions\n",
    "   - Be precise about **integer vs. float** attributes (`.days` is int, `.total_seconds()` is float)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Part B Questions:**\n",
    "   - **Read carefully**: \"which are correct\" means potentially multiple answers\n",
    "   - **Test edge cases**: empty CSV files (ZeroDivisionError), non-existent directories, file exhaustion\n",
    "   - **Know module limitations**: \n",
    "     - `csv.DictReader` returns strings only\n",
    "     - `os.rmdir()` only works on empty directories\n",
    "     - Iterators are consumed after first iteration\n",
    "   - **Recognize Pythonic alternatives**: `max()` with `key` parameter vs. explicit loops\n",
    "   - **Datetime subtraction**: always produces `timedelta`, use `.days` for integer result\n",
    "   - **Cross-platform compatibility**: `os.path.join()` is essential, not hardcoded separators\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sample Debugging Workflow (Exercise 4 Reference)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem:** Summary statistics show negative improvement indices despite positive score changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Debugging Steps:**\n",
    "1. Set breakpoint before `compute_improvements()` call\n",
    "2. Step into function and inspect `pre_score` and `post_score` values\n",
    "3. Check if `post_score > pre_score` but `improvement < 0`\n",
    "4. Trace the improvement calculation: `improvement = post_score - pre_score` (CORRECT) vs `improvement = pre_score - post_score` (BUGGY)\n",
    "5. Fix the formula and re-run to verify\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Insight:** Logic errors (wrong formula) won't raise exceptions; they silently produce incorrect results. Debuggers reveal the truth by letting you observe actual values."
