    "\n",
    "This exercise is accompanied by the *AAPL.csv* file containing historical stock prices for Apple Inc. Your task is to clean the dataset in VS Code so that the following Python code correctly produces a visualization of the closing prices over time.\n",
    "Do **not** modify or write any code for this exercise. Focus solely on cleaning the CSV file.\n",
    "Here are a few recommended steps for this exercise:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Install *pandas* and *matplotlib* using pip.\n",
    "2. Add the *Rainbow CSV* extension to VS Code for better CSV handling.\n",
    "3. Use the keyboard shortcuts from the lecture to format the CSV file properly until the provided code runs without errors. *Hint*: A common date format in coding is `YYYY-MM-DD`, e.g. `2023-06-15`."

Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.--Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States.
